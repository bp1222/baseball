# Baseball Series

This simple application displays Major League Baseball records in a layout of series across the season.  Records
of 87-54 doesn't tell you much about how a team has done over that span.  Did they get really hot for a few series,
or did they end up with a major lull and get rocked for a few months (Source: 2024 Phillies, woof! that after all-star break)


Enjoy!
